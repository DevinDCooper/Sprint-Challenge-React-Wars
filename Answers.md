1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web. React is just a single paradigm, like many other libraries it  provides developers with the ability to build large scale applications effectively.the React team created a simple engine called the virtual DOM the interacts with the actual DOM for us to help with offloading some of the sate data used form our dom taking a lot of pressure off of our browser. 

1. What does it mean to think in react?
   what it means to me is a way to build fast and large app by breaking each part into smaller components and bringing them together at the end.
1. Describe state.
The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
1. Describe props.
Props are arguments passed into React components.
1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
Anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed.we use a hook called useEffect to sync pure components and to change the state or prop without changing the pure component.
